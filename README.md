Welcome to the Telegram Channel Message Forwarder bot! This bot listens to messages in one channel and forwards them to another specified channel. It's a convenient way to share updates and content between different Telegram channels. Let's get started! 🎉

## Prerequisites 📝

- Python 3.5 or higher ✅
- `python-telegram-bot` library (install using `pip install python-telegram-bot`) 🐍

## Getting Started 🚀

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamshaidtahiri/TeleBot-Channel-Message-Forwarder.git
cd TeleBot-Channel-Message-Forwarder
```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Obtain Your Telegram Bot Token:** Obtain your Telegram Bot Token from the [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) on Telegram. 🤖

4. **Configure the Bot:** Open the `tele_bot.py` file and replace `'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'` with your actual bot token.

5. **Specify Source and Destination Channels:** In the `tele_bot.py` file, replace `'SOURCE_CHANNEL_CHAT_ID'` with the chat ID of the channel from which you want to forward messages and `'DESTINATION_CHANNEL_CHAT_ID'` with the chat ID of the channel where you want to send the messages.

6. **Run the Bot:** Start the bot by running the following command:

```bash
python tele_bot.py
```

The bot will now start listening for messages in the source channel and forward them to the destination channel. 🎯
